# push_dev_on_stop.sh — Stop hook: push local dev when it is a clean fast-forward ahead.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-09-02, Mark attended). CLAUDE.md tells sessions to commit
# straight to dev in the main checkout and never to branch there, but nothing in that
# workflow pushes — and mission-control Gate 1 forbids the loop from pulling or pushing the
# shared tree (it may hold a sibling's uncommitted work), so the loop cannot clean up after
# an attended session either. Commits therefore strand on local dev indefinitely: the sync
# that prompted this moved 25 of them, one session's worth of standalone work plus several
# days of attended commits, and the sibling clone ailang-docs was 58 behind with 1 stranded.
# The loop's own worktree -> PR pushes were never the problem (0 push failures in any
# mission log); the attended path was the whole gap.
#
# CONTRACT — FAST-FORWARD ONLY. Ahead AND behind means a real merge is owed, and merges here
# need judgement: the 2026-09-02 sync conflicted on the V1 charter, where a careless
# resolution silently eats decision rows (the skill records one eating decision-ledger:end
# and an entire Goal block). So this refuses that case loudly and leaves it for a human.
#
# NEVER touches the working tree: no pull, no reset, no stash, no checkout, no branch.
# Always exits 0 — a sync problem must never stop a session from ending.
# Opt out with AILANG_AUTOPUSH=0. Portable to macOS bash 3.2; no GNU timeout on this rig.
