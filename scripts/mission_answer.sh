# mission_answer.sh — record an ATTENDED human ruling directly into a mission's
# decision ledger, without a round trip through the bookkeeping issue.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now a decision could only be answered by commenting on a
# PUBLIC bookkeeping issue as an allowlisted author, because that comment was the
# only thing carrying human provenance the loop could check. That made the fast
# path — Mark is at the terminal, in the repo, looking at the ask — the slow one:
# he had to leave the session, find the week's issue, and wait a whole fire for
# the loop to read it back. This script is the attended channel, and it carries
# the SAME trust root the issue channel does: an identity the fleet bot does not
# have and is forbidden to author with.
#
# THE PROVENANCE CONTRACT. An attended resolution is trustworthy only if the loop
# could not have written it itself. The fleet account (`sunholo-voight-kampff`)
# authors every commit the loop makes; this script refuses to run under that
# identity and stamps the row with the attended one. The loop's skill forbids it
# from ever authoring with an attended identity, exactly as mission_directives.sh
# forbids the fleet account from being a directive principal. Both are conventions
# enforced in code at the point of writing and auditable afterwards in `git log`.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not push, and it does not touch anything but the
# one ledger row (and, with --commit, the commit that carries it). Code, gates and
# benchmark curation still route through the loop — see the charter guardrail on
# attended side-sessions.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/mission_answer.sh --id D-51 --answer "TEXT" [--evidence "TEXT"]
#   scripts/mission_answer.sh --id D-51 --answer-file ruling.txt [--evidence-file ev.txt]
#                             [--file design_docs/v1-mission.md] [--commit] [--dry-run]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = row rewritten (and validated), 1 = refused/error.
