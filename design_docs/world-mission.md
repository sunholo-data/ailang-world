# Ailang World Mission — a semantic operating environment whose transaction language is AILANG

<!--
  Charter for the WORLD mission (from mission-charter-TEMPLATE.md, M-MISSION-PORTABILITY M3).
  DRAFTED AT BOOTSTRAP 2026-07-23 — written to be CHALLENGED, not to be final.
  Iteration 0 = ratify this charter (bar + queue + guardrails) through the design quorum
  with Mark, attended. The kill switch stays SET until ratification.
  Thesis document: DESIGN.md (v0.3) in this directory — this charter is its operational
  distillation; where they conflict, the ratified charter governs the loop and the
  conflict gets fixed in DESIGN.md.
-->

**Type**: Long-running mission (peer of the V1 mission in `sunholo-data/ailang`); advanced by a
scheduled outer loop on the always-on rig. **First mission outside the AILANG repo.**
**North star**: ship **Ailang World 1.0** — a local-first semantic operating environment
([DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) §1: an immutable, typed, content-addressed world graph whose transactions
are AILANG programs; propose → verify → commit; capabilities, budgets, evidence, replay) — with
the software-engineering domain live and motoko as the first native agent, subject to the M4
value gate (clause 4 below).
**Traces to**: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (thesis) and the AILANG program's operating model
([PROGRAM.md](https://github.com/sunholo-data/ailang/blob/dev/design_docs/PROGRAM.md) — frozen
minimal core, extension-routed evolution); language gaps found here route BACK to
`sunholo-data/ailang` as issues/backlog items, never worked around locally.
**Skill**: the SAME unforked `mission-control` skill every mission uses, reached via user-level
symlinks (`~/.claude/skills/*`) — this repo carries NO skill copies (a copy is a fork; forks stop
learning).
**Scheduling**: launchd `dev.ailang.mission-world` (installed; **KILL SWITCH SET** —
`~/.ailang/state/mission-world.disabled` — until iteration-0 ratification). StartInterval
staggered vs the V1 loop (shared rig quota). Billing guard: subscription-or-nothing.
**Log**: [world-mission-log.md](world-mission-log.md) — append-only, one entry per iteration.
**Human-facing reporting**: GitHub issue #1 — every iteration posts its report there as a comment
(Mark follows by email); driver crashes post there too.

## Repo Profile (M-MISSION-PORTABILITY M2 — the per-mission values mission-control reads)

- **Repo slug**: `sunholo-data/ailang-world` (driver: `MISSION_REPO`)
- **Mission doc**: `design_docs/world-mission.md` (driver: `MISSION_DOC`)
- **Mission name / state namespace**: `world` (driver: `MISSION_NAME`; fully namespaced
  `~/.ailang/state/mission-world-*` paths — no collision with the V1 loop)
- **Bookkeeping issue**: `#1`, rotates weekly; live number in
  `~/.ailang/state/mission-world-gh-issue` (seeded by the v1 agent after ratification)
- **CI workflows Gate 3b / Gate 1 poll**: `CI` (job: "ailang-code verify gate")
- **Verify profile**: `ailang-code` — the shipped `ailang` binary IS the gate:
  `ailang check` (types), `ailang test` (tests, once test suites exist),
  `ailang ai-check` (unified check+verify: types + Z3 in one JSON — do not reinvent a split
  gate). Repo-wide sweep: `./scripts/verify_ail.sh` (what CI runs; fails loudly on zero modules).
  Go host code (daemon/store, from M1 onward) adds `go build ./... && go test ./...` to the gate
  when it first lands — extend the CI workflow in the same PR that introduces Go code.

## STATUS (rotation rule)

Newest **3** STATUS stamps live here; older ones move to `world-mission-status-archive.md`.
At Gate 4, after adding your stamp, move the now-4th stamp to the TOP of the archive file.

## STATUS 2026-07-23 (iter 0) — Advisory quorum ran headless (BLOCKED 3/3, metered $0.037); ratification PARKED for Mark (attended). Agenda: (1) fix clause-4 numbers, (2) add Conflict Surface section, (3) `ai-check --json` premise defect — v0.30.0 has no such flag. No sprint routed; queue unchanged. See log iter 0 + issue #1.

## STATUS 2026-07-23 — BOOTSTRAP: charter drafted (attended session, Mark + Fable); iteration 0 (quorum ratification) PENDING; kill switch SET; no iterations have fired.

## CURRENT GOAL

1. **Iteration 0 (definition)**: ratify the bar (below) with Mark through the design quorum —
   including fixing clause 4's thresholds NUMERICALLY — then score the queue against it. Output:
   ratified bar + ordered queue in this doc, kill switch released by Mark/v1 agent.
2. **Then**: work the queue through the inner loop (design-doc → sprint-plan → execute →
   evaluate), one sprint-sized item per iteration, recording routing evidence every time.

## The bar — what "Ailang World 1.0" must meet (RATIFY with Mark at iteration 0)

<!-- Distilled from DESIGN.md §14–§17 milestones + §12.4 value thesis + §13.5 priorities.
     Deliberately fewer clauses than milestones: clauses are CHECKABLE END-STATES, not work items. -->

- **Clause 1 — deterministic kernel**: an immutable, content-addressed world store with an
  append-only transition log and **proven deterministic replay** — replaying any recorded episode
  reconstructs state bit-for-bit from pure transitions + recorded effect results. The log-epoch
  semantics decision (DESIGN.md open question 11: interpreter version pinning + content-addressed
  transition functions) is made and enforced BEFORE the log format freezes.
- **Clause 2 — local-first daemon**: `ailang-worldd` runs on one machine over SQLite with CLI +
  REST, **zero cloud dependencies in the core**. Cloud transports exist only as effect-handler
  extensions (or not at all in 1.0).
- **Clause 3 — explicit authority end-to-end**: every effect goes through the broker with a
  capability + budget check; effect results are recorded (replay input); capsules run with a
  physical isolation floor beneath the semantic checks. No ambient-authority path exists from an
  agent to the outside world.
- **Clause 4 — the M4 VALUE GATE (ratified kill-switch)**: motoko operates through world
  transitions (propose → verify → commit) and **matches-or-beats motoko-on-shell** —
  pass-rate within noise on the standard benchmark tier at **≤25% wall-clock overhead**
  (candidate thresholds; FIX NUMERICALLY at iteration 0 so the gate cannot be argued after the
  fact). If the gate fails after honest tuning, **World parks** — same demand-evidence discipline
  as every other item.
- **Clause 5 — the human surface works for real work**: one real goal expressed → proposals →
  approval inbox with evidence bundles → commit → **provenance walk answers "why did this
  happen"** without log archaeology (SCENARIOS.md scenarios 1–3, live).
- **Clause 6 — protocol-native boundary**: the transition registry is served over MCP
  (capability-filtered per session) and an A2A agent card is published; **no new wire protocols**
  (DESIGN.md §3.7).
- **Clause 7 — controlled self-modification proven once**: at least one World behavior change
  ships as an extension package through World's own propose → verify → commit pipeline, with the
  §14 boundaries enforced (mission-loop machinery, AILANG compiler, live daemon EXCLUDED from
  self-mod scope).

## Guardrails (mission-specific; the skill's Standing Rules always apply on top)

- **Local-first is inviolable**: no cloud dependency may enter the World core. Cloud = effect
  handlers behind the broker, post-1.0 unless ratified otherwise.
- **Frozen-kernel discipline from day 1**: default every improvement to an extension; kernel
  changes require explicit human ratification (quorum evidence attached).
- **Never touch the shared loop machinery from this mission**: `tools/launchd/*` (shared driver +
  plist) and the symlinked skills are owned by the shared infrastructure; improvements route via
  Gate-5 retro in the shared skill so ALL missions benefit. NEVER copy skills into this repo.
- **Never touch the V1 mission's state or checkout** (`~/.ailang/state/mission-v1*`, legacy
  `mission-control.*` paths, the `sunholo-data/ailang` working tree).
- **Language gaps route upstream**: anything AILANG can't express cleanly becomes an issue/backlog
  item on `sunholo-data/ailang` — no local compiler workarounds, no vendored forks.
- **Compiler-checked docs discipline**: every `.ail` snippet that enters `design_docs/` ships as a
  checkable file under `design_docs/sketches/` (or a successor source tree) and passes the CI
  gate. A doc claiming "this compiles" without a checked artifact is a defect.
- **Kernel performance budget from day 1** (DESIGN.md §13.5): the M4 overhead gate gets HARDER as
  models get faster — fork cost and verify latency are design constraints on M1, not later
  optimizations.
- **Kill switch stays until ratification**; only Mark (or the v1 agent on his instruction) arms
  the loop.

## Routing policy

Uses the **shared** per-role model routing from `mission-control` (controller /
designer-rotation / planner / executor / evaluator, generator≠judge enforced). Overrides for THIS
mission in `~/.config/ailang/mission-world.env`:

- **Executor default**: NON-Anthropic lane — `codex` (e.g. `MISSION_EXECUTOR_MODEL=codex:gpt-5.6-sol`)
  per the shared quota plan, once the fleet lanes are wired for this repo; until then the profile's
  documented interim default (opus, subscription) applies. Wiring the codex lane is part of
  iteration 0's checklist.
- **Evaluator**: must differ in provider from the executor (generator≠judge) — sonnet or
  gemini when the executor is codex.
- Otherwise: inherits the shared defaults.

**Document created**: 2026-07-23 (bootstrap, attended). Iteration 0 ratifies it via the quorum
with Mark before any sprint routes. The kill switch stays set until then.
