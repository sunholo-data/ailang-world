# Ailang World Mission — a semantic operating environment whose transaction language is AILANG

<!--
  Charter for the WORLD mission (from mission-charter-TEMPLATE.md, M-MISSION-PORTABILITY M3).
  DRAFTED AT BOOTSTRAP 2026-07-23 — written to be CHALLENGED, not to be final.
  Iteration 0 = ratify this charter (bar + queue + guardrails) through the design quorum
  with Mark, attended. The kill switch stays SET until ratification.
  Thesis document: DESIGN.md (v0.3) in this directory — this charter is its operational
  distillation; where they conflict, the ratified charter governs the loop and the
  conflict gets fixed in DESIGN.md.
-->

**Type**: Long-running mission (peer of the V1 mission in `sunholo-data/ailang`); advanced by a
scheduled outer loop on the always-on rig. **First mission outside the AILANG repo.**
**North star**: ship **Ailang World 1.0** — a local-first semantic operating environment
([DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) §1: an immutable, typed, content-addressed world graph whose transactions
are AILANG programs; propose → verify → commit; capabilities, budgets, evidence, replay) — with
the software-engineering domain live and motoko as the first native agent, subject to the M4
value gate (clause 4 below).
**Traces to**: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (thesis) and the AILANG program's operating model
([PROGRAM.md](https://github.com/sunholo-data/ailang/blob/dev/design_docs/PROGRAM.md) — frozen
minimal core, extension-routed evolution); language gaps found here route BACK to
`sunholo-data/ailang` as issues/backlog items, never worked around locally.
**Skill**: the SAME unforked `mission-control` skill every mission uses, reached via user-level
symlinks (`~/.claude/skills/*`) — this repo carries NO skill copies (a copy is a fork; forks stop
learning).
**Scheduling**: launchd `dev.ailang.mission-world` — **ARMED by Mark 2026-07-23** ahead of
ratification; sprint-routing stays BLOCKED until the charter is ratified (iter-0 honored this:
quorum-only, no sprint). Off switch: `~/.ailang/state/mission-world.disabled`. StartInterval
staggered vs the V1 loop (shared rig quota). Billing guard: subscription-or-nothing.
**Log**: [world-mission-log.md](world-mission-log.md) — append-only, one entry per iteration.
**Human-facing reporting**: GitHub issue #1 — every iteration posts its report there as a comment
(Mark follows by email); driver crashes post there too.

## Repo Profile (M-MISSION-PORTABILITY M2 — the per-mission values mission-control reads)

- **Repo slug**: `sunholo-data/ailang-world` (driver: `MISSION_REPO`)
- **Mission doc**: `design_docs/world-mission.md` (driver: `MISSION_DOC`)
- **Mission name / state namespace**: `world` (driver: `MISSION_NAME`; fully namespaced
  `~/.ailang/state/mission-world-*` paths — no collision with the V1 loop)
- **Bookkeeping issue**: `#1`, rotates weekly; live number in
  `~/.ailang/state/mission-world-gh-issue` (seeded by the v1 agent after ratification)
- **CI workflows Gate 3b / Gate 1 poll**: `CI` (job: "ailang-code verify gate")
- **Verify profile**: `ailang-code` — the shipped `ailang` binary IS the gate:
  `ailang check` (types), `ailang test` (tests, once test suites exist),
  `ailang ai-check` (unified check+verify: types + Z3 in one JSON — do not reinvent a split
  gate). Repo-wide sweep: `./scripts/verify_ail.sh` (what CI runs; fails loudly on zero modules).
  Go host code (daemon/store, from M1 onward) adds `go build ./... && go test ./...` to the gate
  when it first lands — extend the CI workflow in the same PR that introduces Go code.

## STATUS (rotation rule)

Newest **3** STATUS stamps live here; older ones move to `world-mission-status-archive.md`.
At Gate 4, after adding your stamp, move the now-4th stamp to the TOP of the archive file.

## STATUS 2026-07-23 (iter 0 CLOSED) — **CHARTER RATIFIED by Mark, attended session with the World coordinator.** Clause-4 fixed: −2pp pass-rate (paired N≥3, standard tier) + ≤25% median wall-clock overhead. Bar + Conflict Surface + guardrails + queue ratified as drafted. Ratification record: issue #1 comment + commits `46f8b57` (clause-4 numbers) · `8f61dcb`/`a86e997` (quorum-objection evidence, live tests). Advisory quorum ledger: **5 rounds** run attended (~$0.23 metered total), every round's objections closed with evidence — live tests where possible (artifacts: `.ailang/state/mission-quorum/world-mission-2026-07-23T*.json`). The quorum is reject-by-default and ADVISORY: its job here is objection-surfacing, not blessing; no further rounds sought — the authority gate is Mark's, exercised. **Loop is CLEAR to route `[NEXT] w-log-epoch-decision`.**

## STATUS 2026-07-23 (iter 0) — Advisory quorum ran headless (BLOCKED 3/3, metered $0.037); ratification PARKED for Mark (attended). Agenda: (1) fix clause-4 numbers, (2) add Conflict Surface section, (3) `ai-check --json` premise defect — v0.30.0 has no such flag. No sprint routed; queue unchanged. See log iter 0 + issue #1.

## STATUS 2026-07-23 — BOOTSTRAP: charter drafted (attended session, Mark + Fable); iteration 0 (quorum ratification) PENDING; kill switch SET; no iterations have fired.

## CURRENT GOAL

1. ~~Iteration 0: ratify the bar~~ — **DONE 2026-07-23 attended** (Mark: clause-4 fixed at
   −2pp / ≤25%; bar + Conflict Surface + guardrails + queue ratified as drafted; re-quorum run
   attended — see STATUS).
2. **NOW**: work the queue through the inner loop (design-doc → sprint-plan → execute →
   evaluate), one sprint-sized item per iteration, recording routing evidence every time.
   Next item: `[NEXT] w-log-epoch-decision` (clause-1).

## The bar — what "Ailang World 1.0" must meet (RATIFIED by Mark 2026-07-23, attended — see STATUS + issue #1 record)

<!-- Distilled from DESIGN.md §14–§17 milestones + §12.4 value thesis + §13.5 priorities.
     Deliberately fewer clauses than milestones: clauses are CHECKABLE END-STATES, not work items. -->

- **Clause 1 — deterministic kernel**: an immutable, content-addressed world store with an
  append-only transition log and **proven deterministic replay** — replaying any recorded episode
  reconstructs state bit-for-bit from pure transitions + recorded effect results. The log-epoch
  semantics decision (DESIGN.md open question 11: interpreter version pinning + content-addressed
  transition functions) is made and enforced BEFORE the log format freezes.
- **Clause 2 — local-first daemon**: `ailang-worldd` runs on one machine over SQLite with CLI +
  REST, **zero cloud dependencies in the core**. Cloud transports exist only as effect-handler
  extensions (or not at all in 1.0).
- **Clause 3 — explicit authority end-to-end**: every effect goes through the broker with a
  capability + budget check; effect results are recorded (replay input); capsules run with a
  physical isolation floor beneath the semantic checks. No ambient-authority path exists from an
  agent to the outside world.
- **Clause 4 — the M4 VALUE GATE (kill-switch; thresholds RATIFIED by Mark 2026-07-23)**: motoko
  operates through world transitions (propose → verify → commit) and **matches-or-beats
  motoko-on-shell**, measured as PAIRED runs (N≥3 per arm, same benchmark set, standard tier):
  **World pass-rate ≥ shell pass-rate − 2 percentage points AND median wall-clock overhead
  ≤ +25%**. If the gate fails after honest tuning, **World parks** — same demand-evidence
  discipline as every other item.
- **Clause 5 — the human surface works for real work**: one real goal expressed → proposals →
  approval inbox with evidence bundles → commit → **provenance walk answers "why did this
  happen"** without log archaeology (SCENARIOS.md scenarios 1–3, live).
- **Clause 6 — protocol-native boundary**: the transition registry is served over MCP
  (capability-filtered per session) and an A2A agent card is published; **no new wire protocols**
  (DESIGN.md §3.7).
- **Clause 7 — controlled self-modification proven once**: at least one World behavior change
  ships as an extension package through World's own propose → verify → commit pipeline, with the
  §14 boundaries enforced (mission-loop machinery, AILANG compiler, live daemon EXCLUDED from
  self-mod scope).

## Conflict Surface (RATIFIED 2026-07-23 with the bar; drafted post-iter-0 to answer quorum objection #2)

What this mission touches or overlaps, and the drawn boundaries:

- **`ailang serve-api` (ailang repo)** — the overlap is the PROTOCOL BOUNDARY only.
  **VERIFIED (code inspection 2026-07-23, `internal/apiserver/` at ailang HEAD)**: the package
  advertises NO persistence or scheduling API — zero sqlite/sql.Open/bolt/badger/scheduler hits
  package-wide; request-scoped serving of module exports over REST/MCP/A2A (`mcp.go`, `a2a.go`,
  `handler.go`, `routes_dispatch.go`). Precision note (quorum round-5): the load-bearing form of
  this claim is "no advertised state machinery to build a world kernel on" — verified from the
  package surface; exhaustive absence-of-state through transitive calls is neither claimed nor
  needed, because the daemon justification runs the other way: worldd needs a store + log +
  broker + scheduler that apiserver does not offer, while apiserver's protocol serving IS reused
  (path (a), demonstrated live). A new daemon is justified by state, not by protocol.
  **ALSO VERIFIED**: `internal/apiserver` is a Go `internal/` package → NOT importable from
  another repo. "Reuse" is therefore one of three concrete paths, in preference order:
  (a) **primary**: World exposes its transition registry AS `.ail` modules served by
  `ailang serve-api --mcp/--a2a` — **VERIFIED for static module exports (live test
  2026-07-23)**: served `design_docs/sketches/` over `--mcp-http`, and `tools/list` returned
  `plan`/`verify`/`commit` as MCP tools with schemas + effect signatures. **NOT claimed**
  (explicitly w-mcp-projection's ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, not premises): dynamic worldd-backed
  registry, per-session capability filtering, propose→verify→commit enforcement at the
  boundary — if those fail there, fall to (b)/(c); (b) fallback: worldd runs `ailang
  serve-api` as a sidecar process; (c) only on evidence: upstream issue to export a public
  serving package. Grafting a world
  store onto serve-api itself stays ruled out — it would move OS concerns into the frozen
  language repo, the wrong direction under PROGRAM.md.
- **The `ailang` binary / compiler (frozen core)** — worldd consumes the RELEASED binary
  (`check`/`test`/`ai-check`/serve-api) and never links compiler internals; language gaps route
  upstream as issues (guardrail above).
- **Coordinator / Collaboration Hub (ailang repo)** — pattern overlap only (approval queue,
  messaging). Patterns port; schemas do not. World's human surfaces are projections from the
  world store (SCENARIOS.md scenario 1), not extensions of the Hub; no shared database.
- **The mission loop itself** — the loop that builds this repo stays OUTSIDE World's
  self-modification scope (DESIGN.md §14). When M4 puts motoko on World, the mission loop is
  unchanged; only motoko's execution substrate changes.
- **OPEN for ratification**: whether worldd lives in THIS repo as its own Go module (DESIGN.md
  §15 assumption, coordinator-recommended: keeps the language repo frozen, lets World iterate at
  its own cadence) vs an `ailang world` subcommand upstream. Revisit only on concrete
  binary-distribution pain.

## Guardrails (mission-specific; the skill's Standing Rules always apply on top)

- **Local-first is inviolable**: no cloud dependency may enter the World core. Cloud = effect
  handlers behind the broker, post-1.0 unless ratified otherwise.
- **Frozen-kernel discipline from day 1**: default every improvement to an extension; kernel
  changes require explicit human ratification (quorum evidence attached).
- **Never touch the shared loop machinery from this mission**: `tools/launchd/*` (shared driver +
  plist) and the symlinked skills are owned by the shared infrastructure; improvements route via
  Gate-5 retro in the shared skill so ALL missions benefit. NEVER copy skills into this repo.
- **Never touch the V1 mission's state or checkout** (`~/.ailang/state/mission-v1*`, legacy
  `mission-control.*` paths, the `sunholo-data/ailang` working tree).
- **Language gaps route upstream — two channels, always both**: anything AILANG can't express
  cleanly (or any core/binary change World needs) becomes (1) a GitHub issue on
  `sunholo-data/ailang` — the durable, triageable record with repro + version per that repo's
  conventions — AND (2) an agent message to the v1 loop's inbox so it is seen without waiting for
  a triage sweep: `ailang messages send mission-control "<summary + issue link>" --title "..."
  --from "world-coordinator"` (local send on this rig; the v1 session's start hook surfaces
  unread messages). The V1 mission owns routing it (extension vs core-floor per PROGRAM.md);
  World NEVER works around the compiler locally, no vendored forks.
- **Compiler-checked docs discipline**: every `.ail` snippet that enters `design_docs/` ships as a
  checkable file under `design_docs/sketches/` (or a successor source tree) and passes the CI
  gate. A doc claiming "this compiles" without a checked artifact is a defect.
- **Kernel performance budget from day 1** (DESIGN.md §13.5): the M4 overhead gate gets HARDER as
  models get faster — fork cost and verify latency are design constraints on M1, not later
  optimizations.
- **Kill switch stays until ratification**; only Mark (or the v1 agent on his instruction) arms
  the loop.

## Routing policy

Uses the **shared** per-role model routing from `mission-control` (controller /
designer-rotation / planner / executor / evaluator, generator≠judge enforced). Overrides for THIS
mission in `~/.config/ailang/mission-world.env`:

- **Executor default**: NON-Anthropic lane — `codex` (e.g. `MISSION_EXECUTOR_MODEL=codex:gpt-5.6-sol`)
  per the shared quota plan, once the fleet lanes are wired for this repo; until then the profile's
  documented interim default (opus, subscription) applies. Wiring the codex lane is part of
  iteration 0's checklist.
- **Evaluator**: must differ in provider from the executor (generator≠judge) — sonnet or
  gemini when the executor is codex.
- Otherwise: inherits the shared defaults.
