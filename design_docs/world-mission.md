# Ailang World Mission — a semantic operating environment whose transaction language is AILANG

<!--
  Charter for the WORLD mission (from mission-charter-TEMPLATE.md, M-MISSION-PORTABILITY M3).
  DRAFTED AT BOOTSTRAP 2026-07-23 — written to be CHALLENGED, not to be final.
  Iteration 0 = ratify this charter (bar + queue + guardrails) through the design quorum
  with Mark, attended. The kill switch stays SET until ratification.
  Thesis document: DESIGN.md (v0.3) in this directory — this charter is its operational
  distillation; where they conflict, the ratified charter governs the loop and the
  conflict gets fixed in DESIGN.md.
-->

**Type**: Long-running mission (peer of the V1 mission in `sunholo-data/ailang`); advanced by a
scheduled outer loop on the always-on rig. **First mission outside the AILANG repo.**
**North star**: ship **Ailang World 1.0** — a local-first semantic operating environment
([DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) §1: an immutable, typed, content-addressed world graph whose transactions
are AILANG programs; propose → verify → commit; capabilities, budgets, evidence, replay) — with
the software-engineering domain live — value proven by clause 5's provenance teeth + the R1
standing evidence, floored by clause 4's resident-agent non-inferiority check (motoko remains
the aspirational first *native* agent as an optional arm).
**Traces to**: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (thesis) and the AILANG program's operating model
([PROGRAM.md](https://github.com/sunholo-data/ailang/blob/dev/design_docs/PROGRAM.md) — frozen
minimal core, extension-routed evolution); language gaps found here route BACK to
`sunholo-data/ailang` as issues/backlog items, never worked around locally.
**Skill**: the SAME unforked `mission-control` skill every mission uses, reached via user-level
symlinks (`~/.claude/skills/*`) — this repo carries NO skill copies (a copy is a fork; forks stop
learning).
**Scheduling**: launchd `dev.ailang.mission-world` — **ARMED by Mark 2026-07-23** ahead of
ratification; sprint-routing stays BLOCKED until the charter is ratified (iter-0 honored this:
quorum-only, no sprint). Off switch: `~/.ailang/state/mission-world.disabled`. StartInterval
staggered vs the V1 loop (shared rig quota). Billing guard: subscription-or-nothing.
**Log**: [world-mission-log.md](world-mission-log.md) — append-only, one entry per iteration.
**Human-facing reporting**: GitHub issue #1 — every iteration posts its report there as a comment
(Mark follows by email); driver crashes post there too.

## Repo Profile (M-MISSION-PORTABILITY M2 — the per-mission values mission-control reads)

- **Repo slug**: `sunholo-data/ailang-world` (driver: `MISSION_REPO`)
- **Mission doc**: `design_docs/world-mission.md` (driver: `MISSION_DOC`)
- **Mission name / state namespace**: `world` (driver: `MISSION_NAME`; fully namespaced
  `~/.ailang/state/mission-world-*` paths — no collision with the V1 loop)
- **Bookkeeping issue**: `#1`, rotates weekly; live number in
  `~/.ailang/state/mission-world-gh-issue` (seeded by the v1 agent after ratification)
- **CI workflows Gate 3b / Gate 1 poll**: `CI` (job: "ailang-code verify gate")
- **Verify profile**: `ailang-code` — the shipped `ailang` binary IS the gate:
  `ailang check` (types), `ailang test` (tests, once test suites exist),
  `ailang ai-check` (unified check+verify: types + Z3 in one JSON — do not reinvent a split
  gate). Repo-wide sweep: `./scripts/verify_ail.sh` (what CI runs; fails loudly on zero modules).
  Go host code (daemon/store, from M1 onward) adds `go build ./... && go test ./...` to the gate
  when it first lands — extend the CI workflow in the same PR that introduces Go code.

## STATUS (rotation rule)

Newest **3** STATUS stamps live here; older ones move to `world-mission-status-archive.md`.
At Gate 4, after adding your stamp, move the now-4th stamp to the TOP of the archive file.

## STATUS 2026-07-24 (iteration 3) — **Queue still HUMAN-BLOCKED on D1 (2nd consecutive); no sprint — but NOT a no-op: turned the idle fire into D1 decision-support.** Preflight clean: armed, billing CLEAN, account `sunholo-voight-kampff`, dev==origin/dev `b337ee2`, CI green @ HEAD, no nightly regressions, no Mark comment (D1 unanswered), no directive. Inbox: 2 informational (mission-v1 iter-95 status; eval-suite auto-notify) — acked, no queue impact. Ran the "is there REALLY nothing to do?" check: Option B of D1 hinges on whether a released `ailang` exposes a platform-independent **semantics-version identity** (= upstream ailang#471). Probed the shipped binary `v0.30.0`: `ailang version` gives a **source** identity (release tag+commit — platform-independent but not proven-semantics), `ailangVersion()` bundles `platform` (platform-dependent), and **no** conformance/spec/semantics-hash subcommand exists. **Finding: Option B is corpus-gated-only today; nothing upstream makes it "proven"** → D1 reduces to **A/C (deterministic, platform-locked) vs B (portable, probabilistic)**. Posted as evidence to ailang#471 (comment 5064518731) + pinged V1 (informational). Does NOT decide D1 (Mark's values call) — narrows it. `metered=$0.00`. **Retro: instance 2 of the fully-human-blocked-queue friction (iter-2 = instance 1) → meets the ≥2 bar for a shared-skill fix, but World CANNOT edit the shared skill (it lives in the V1 checkout; V1 iter-95 edited it ~1h prior) → PROPOSED patch routed to Mark + V1, not applied.** No queue changes (D1 still parked). Watermark unchanged (no Mark comment). No weekly rotation (8<80 comments, post-Monday-boundary issue).

## STATUS 2026-07-23 (iteration 2) — **Queue HUMAN-BLOCKED on D1; no sprint routed (bookkeeping-only iteration).** The entire queue depends on Mark's parked D1 replay-pin decision: item 1 PARKED-for-human, item 2 (M1) BLOCKED on it, items 3–5 chain on M1 (which freezes the log format D1 governs), 6–8 explicitly parked. No sprint-executable or critical-path design item is independent of D1 → correctly declined to force speculative M2/M3 work (rework risk; "data before conclusions"). Preflight clean: armed, billing CLEAN, account `sunholo-voight-kampff`, dev==origin/dev `5219e54`, CI green, no nightly regressions, no Mark comment, no directive. Inbox: 1 cross-mission status note from mission-v1 (their docs-CI fix, informational — acked). Upstream ailang#471 (feeds D1) still OPEN/unanswered. D1 ask already crisply on issue #1 (iter-1) → no re-nag. Watermark `19:25:04Z`→`20:13:54Z`; no weekly rotation (7<80 comments, issue post-Monday-boundary). `metered=$0.00`. Retro watch-item (instance 1): shared skill assumes "queue always has a next item" — a 100%-human-blocked queue needs a headless back-off rule if it recurs (no skill edit yet, needs 2nd instance).

## STATUS 2026-07-23 (iteration 1) — **First post-ratification sprint: `w-log-epoch-decision` (clause-1). D2 (content-addressed transition functions — canonical source-byte hash) + D3 (SHA-256 with explicit tagged `HashRef`) SETTLED (no quorum objection, 2 rounds). D1 replay-pin identity PARKED needs-human-review on the determinism⇄portability fork.** Designer = Fable (rotation seed, subscription via `claude-sub`; design + 1 revision). Quorum: r1 BLOCKED (both reviewers: corpus attestation ≠ semantic equivalence → "any attested binary" replay is non-deterministic) → revision pinned the exact content-addressed interpreter artifact → r2 BLOCKED (reviewers split in opposite directions: hermeticity vs cross-platform portability). Bounded pick-time protocol (1 revision + 1 re-quorum) exhausted → parked for Mark with a 3-option framing (A exact-binary / B release-identity+corpus-gated / C runtime-closure). Upstream question routed both channels: **ailang#471** (does a released binary expose a platform-independent semantics-version identity for portable replay?). Doc committed `c3c5124`, CI green. `metered=$0.123`. Queue item 1 → `[PARKED]`; item 2 (w-world-library-m1) stays blocked on this decision.

## CURRENT GOAL

1. ~~Iteration 0: ratify the bar~~ — **DONE 2026-07-23 attended** (Mark: clause-4 fixed at
   −2pp / ≤25%; bar + Conflict Surface + guardrails + queue ratified as drafted; re-quorum run
   attended — see STATUS).
2. **NOW**: work the queue through the inner loop (design-doc → sprint-plan → execute →
   evaluate), one sprint-sized item per iteration, recording routing evidence every time.
   Next item WAS `w-log-epoch-decision` (clause-1) — iteration 1 drafted + quorum-reviewed it;
   D2/D3 settled, **D1 replay-pin PARKED for Mark** (determinism⇄portability fork; see the doc's
   "Open Decision" section + issue #1). The queue is blocked on that human decision until Mark
   picks a D1 option; on his reply the item unparks and M1 (`w-world-library-m1`) proceeds.

## The bar — what "Ailang World 1.0" must meet (RATIFIED by Mark 2026-07-23, attended — see STATUS + issue #1 record)

<!-- Distilled from DESIGN.md §14–§17 milestones + §12.4 value thesis + §13.5 priorities.
     Deliberately fewer clauses than milestones: clauses are CHECKABLE END-STATES, not work items. -->

- **Clause 1 — deterministic kernel**: an immutable, content-addressed world store with an
  append-only transition log and **proven deterministic replay** — replaying any recorded episode
  reconstructs state bit-for-bit from pure transitions + recorded effect results. The log-epoch
  semantics decision (DESIGN.md open question 11: interpreter version pinning + content-addressed
  transition functions) is made and enforced BEFORE the log format freezes.
- **Clause 2 — local-first daemon**: `ailang-worldd` runs on one machine over SQLite with CLI +
  REST, **zero cloud dependencies in the core**. Cloud transports exist only as effect-handler
  extensions (or not at all in 1.0).
- **Clause 3 — explicit authority end-to-end**: every effect goes through the broker with a
  capability + budget check; effect results are recorded (replay input); capsules run with a
  physical isolation floor beneath the semantic checks. No ambient-authority path exists from an
  agent to the outside world.
- **Clause 4 — the M4 RESIDENT-AGENT NON-INFERIORITY FLOOR (do-no-harm kill-switch; thresholds
  ratified 2026-07-23; agent definition + framing AMENDED by Mark same day, attended)**: this
  clause is the FLOOR, deliberately NOT the value proof — agents are World's *residents*, not
  its destination, and a substrate that taxes its residents dies before its systemic value can
  accrue. World's VALUE is measured by clause 5's provenance teeth and the R1 standing evidence
  (below). The floor: **TWO reference agents from different providers — Claude Code (agent mode)
  and codex CLI** — each in paired arms: *shell* (native tools) vs *World* (MCP transition tools
  only), same model, same benchmark set (standard tier), N≥3 runs per arm. **The floor holds
  only if BOTH reference agents show: World pass-rate ≥ shell pass-rate − 2 percentage points
  AND median wall-clock overhead ≤ +25%** (non-inferiority, not superiority — by design).
  **Stability precondition (gate validity, not gate outcome)**: a reference agent is
  gate-eligible only if its SHELL arm completes N≥3 runs with zero harness-fault failures
  (api_error / resource_limit / harness classes) and pass-rate range ≤5pp; an ineligible agent
  is fixed or substituted — if both become ineligible the gate PAUSES for instrumentation (a
  measurement problem, explicitly NOT a value-park). If the gate fails on eligible agents after
  honest tuning, **World parks**. **motoko is an OPTIONAL third arm** — the local-first/R5
  narrative, run only if it meets the same precondition, informative and NEVER gate-blocking
  (amendment rationale: motoko's current instability would make the baseline metrologically
  unsound — Mark 2026-07-23).
- **Clause 5 — the human surface works, with PROVENANCE TEETH (the 1.0 value demonstration;
  strengthened by Mark 2026-07-23)**: one real goal expressed → proposals → approval inbox with
  evidence bundles → commit (SCENARIOS.md scenarios 1–3, live) — AND, measurably: **on ≥3 REAL
  "why did X happen" questions (arising from actual operation, not synthetic), a provenance walk
  yields the verified answer in ≤5 minutes each**, where the pre-World method was a grep/log
  archaeology session. This — capability the shell cannot express at any pass-rate — is what
  World is FOR; clause 4 only proves it isn't paid for with resident-agent regression.
  **Standing value evidence beyond the 1.0 bar: R1** — this mission itself migrating onto World,
  measured on incident classes eliminated + human attention per workstream against the 2026-07
  markdown-and-launchd baseline (tonight's operation IS the control arm).
- **Clause 6 — protocol-native boundary**: the transition registry is served over MCP
  (capability-filtered per session) and an A2A agent card is published; **no new wire protocols**
  (DESIGN.md §3.7).
- **Clause 7 — controlled self-modification proven once**: at least one World behavior change
  ships as an extension package through World's own propose → verify → commit pipeline, with the
  §14 boundaries enforced (mission-loop machinery, AILANG compiler, live daemon EXCLUDED from
  self-mod scope).

## Conflict Surface (RATIFIED 2026-07-23 with the bar; drafted post-iter-0 to answer quorum objection #2)

What this mission touches or overlaps, and the drawn boundaries:

- **`ailang serve-api` (ailang repo)** — the overlap is the PROTOCOL BOUNDARY only.
  **VERIFIED (code inspection 2026-07-23, `internal/apiserver/` at ailang HEAD)**: the package
  advertises NO persistence or scheduling API — zero sqlite/sql.Open/bolt/badger/scheduler hits
  package-wide; request-scoped serving of module exports over REST/MCP/A2A (`mcp.go`, `a2a.go`,
  `handler.go`, `routes_dispatch.go`). Precision note (quorum round-5): the load-bearing form of
  this claim is "no advertised state machinery to build a world kernel on" — verified from the
  package surface; exhaustive absence-of-state through transitive calls is neither claimed nor
  needed, because the daemon justification runs the other way: worldd needs a store + log +
  broker + scheduler that apiserver does not offer, while apiserver's protocol serving IS reused
  (path (a), demonstrated live). A new daemon is justified by state, not by protocol.
  **ALSO VERIFIED**: `internal/apiserver` is a Go `internal/` package → NOT importable from
  another repo. "Reuse" is therefore one of three concrete paths, in preference order:
  (a) **primary**: World exposes its transition registry AS `.ail` modules served by
  `ailang serve-api --mcp/--a2a` — **VERIFIED for static module exports (live test
  2026-07-23)**: served `design_docs/sketches/` over `--mcp-http`, and `tools/list` returned
  `plan`/`verify`/`commit` as MCP tools with schemas + effect signatures. **NOT claimed**
  (explicitly w-mcp-projection's ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, not premises): dynamic worldd-backed
  registry, per-session capability filtering, propose→verify→commit enforcement at the
  boundary — if those fail there, fall to (b)/(c); (b) fallback: worldd runs `ailang
  serve-api` as a sidecar process; (c) only on evidence: upstream issue to export a public
  serving package. Grafting a world
  store onto serve-api itself stays ruled out — it would move OS concerns into the frozen
  language repo, the wrong direction under PROGRAM.md.
- **The `ailang` binary / compiler (frozen core)** — worldd consumes the RELEASED binary
  (`check`/`test`/`ai-check`/serve-api) and never links compiler internals; language gaps route
  upstream as issues (guardrail above).
- **Coordinator / Collaboration Hub (ailang repo)** — pattern overlap only (approval queue,
  messaging). Patterns port; schemas do not. World's human surfaces are projections from the
  world store (SCENARIOS.md scenario 1), not extensions of the Hub; no shared database.
- **The mission loop itself** — the loop that builds this repo stays OUTSIDE World's
  self-modification scope (DESIGN.md §14). When M4 puts motoko on World, the mission loop is
  unchanged; only motoko's execution substrate changes.
- **OPEN for ratification**: whether worldd lives in THIS repo as its own Go module (DESIGN.md
  §15 assumption, coordinator-recommended: keeps the language repo frozen, lets World iterate at
  its own cadence) vs an `ailang world` subcommand upstream. Revisit only on concrete
  binary-distribution pain.

## Guardrails (mission-specific; the skill's Standing Rules always apply on top)

- **Local-first is inviolable**: no cloud dependency may enter the World core. Cloud = effect
  handlers behind the broker, post-1.0 unless ratified otherwise.
- **Frozen-kernel discipline from day 1**: default every improvement to an extension; kernel
  changes require explicit human ratification (quorum evidence attached).
- **Never touch the shared loop machinery from this mission**: `tools/launchd/*` (shared driver +
  plist) and the symlinked skills are owned by the shared infrastructure; improvements route via
  Gate-5 retro in the shared skill so ALL missions benefit. NEVER copy skills into this repo.
- **Never touch the V1 mission's state or checkout** (`~/.ailang/state/mission-v1*`, legacy
  `mission-control.*` paths, the `sunholo-data/ailang` working tree).
- **Language gaps route upstream — two channels, always both**: anything AILANG can't express
  cleanly (or any core/binary change World needs) becomes (1) a GitHub issue on
  `sunholo-data/ailang` — the durable, triageable record with repro + version per that repo's
  conventions — AND (2) an agent message to the v1 loop's inbox so it is seen without waiting for
  a triage sweep: `ailang messages send mission-control "<summary + issue link>" --title "..."
  --from "world-coordinator"` (local send on this rig; the v1 session's start hook surfaces
  unread messages). The V1 mission owns routing it (extension vs core-floor per PROGRAM.md);
  World NEVER works around the compiler locally, no vendored forks.
- **Compiler-checked docs discipline**: every `.ail` snippet that enters `design_docs/` ships as a
  checkable file under `design_docs/sketches/` (or a successor source tree) and passes the CI
  gate. A doc claiming "this compiles" without a checked artifact is a defect.
- **Kernel performance budget from day 1** (DESIGN.md §13.5): the M4 overhead gate gets HARDER as
  models get faster — fork cost and verify latency are design constraints on M1, not later
  optimizations.
- **Advisory quorum rounds are BOUNDED** (ratified by Mark 2026-07-23, from the 5-round
  iteration-0 ledger): on ratification-class docs (charter, bar changes), at most **2 quorum
  rounds per revision cycle**. The quorum's job there is objection-SURFACING for the human
  authority gate — it holds no veto, a synthesized PASS is not required, and rounds must never
  be re-run in search of one. When objections stop being load-bearing, close on the human gate
  and record the ledger. (Design-doc quorums at pick keep their normal semantics — BLOCKED
  parks the item.)
- **Kill switch stays until ratification**; only Mark (or the v1 agent on his instruction) arms
  the loop.

## Routing policy

Uses the **shared** per-role model routing from `mission-control` (controller /
designer-rotation / planner / executor / evaluator, generator≠judge enforced). Overrides for THIS
mission in `~/.config/ailang/mission-world.env`:

- **Executor default**: NON-Anthropic lane — `codex` (e.g. `MISSION_EXECUTOR_MODEL=codex:gpt-5.6-sol`)
  per the shared quota plan, once the fleet lanes are wired for this repo; until then the profile's
  documented interim default (opus, subscription) applies. Wiring the codex lane is part of
  iteration 0's checklist.
- **Evaluator**: must differ in provider from the executor (generator≠judge) — sonnet or
  gemini when the executor is codex.
- Otherwise: inherits the shared defaults.

## Queue (top = next; tags: [NEXT] [IN-SPRINT] [PARKED] [LANDED] [RULED OUT])

<!-- Every open item carries a clause tag. Estimates are honest guesses at bootstrap;
     iteration 0 re-scores. NEW-DOC items start with design-doc-creator. -->

   determinism⇄portability fork (3 options framed in the doc's "Open Decision" section).
   Doc: `design_docs/planned/w-log-epoch-decision.md` (`c3c5124`, CI green). Upstream Q: ailang#471.
